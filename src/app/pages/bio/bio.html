  <p>
    VP of Development at
    <a href="https://ssw.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >SSW</a
    >. I lead teams of developers, architects, and consultants to deliver
    high-quality, enterprise software solutions for our clients.
  </p>
  <p>
    These days, I spend most of my time mentoring, coaching, and supporting
    other developers to help them grow their skills and advance their careers.
    But there's still a bit of coding in there too, when I can find the time.

  <h2 class="text-2xl">Background</h2>
  <p>
    Over 20 years in software development, starting with ye olde .NET Framework
    1.1 and glorious WebForms, running on IIS6. Since then, I have worked with a
    variety of technologies; some of the Clouds, most of the JavaScript
    frameworks, and all of the .NETs.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been architecting and leading teams for the last 8 years, and swing
    between never wanting to write another line of code and being so excited
    about the latest tech that I can't pull myself away from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    My favourite question is "Why?". You can't figure out what you need to
    build, until you understand why you need to build it.
