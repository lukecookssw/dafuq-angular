  <p>
    <b>VP of Development</b> and <b>Solution Architect</b> at
    <a href="https://ssw.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >SSW</a
    >. I lead teams of developers, designers, and consultants to deliver
    high-quality enterprise software solutions for both public and private sector.
  </p>
  <p>
    I spend a lot of my time mentoring, coaching, and supporting
    other developers to help them grow their skills and advance their careers.
    But there's still a bit of coding in there too, when I can find the time ðŸ™‚

  <h2 class="text-2xl">Background</h2>
  <p>
    Over 20 years in software development, starting with ye olde .NET Framework
    1.1 and glorious WebForms, running on IIS6. I have worked with a
    huge variety of architecture and technologies; many I like, and some I don't.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've been architecting and leading teams for the last 8 years, and move
    between development/architectural duties, and business strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
    My favourite question is "Why?". You can't determine out what you need to
    build, until you understand why you need to build it.
